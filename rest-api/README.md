## API Usage Examples

### Create a New Branch

```http
POST /api/branches
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "Dhaka Main Branch",
    "district": "Dhaka",
    "region": "Central"
}
```

### Create a New Client

```http
POST /api/clients
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "Rahman Ahmed",
    "gender": "MALE",
    "branch_id": 1,
    "registration_date": "2024-01-15"
}
```

### Issue a New Loan

```http
POST /api/loans
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "client_id": 1,
    "branch_id": 1,
    "loan_amount": 50000.00,
    "interest_rate": 12.5,
    "issue_date": "2024-01-20",
    "tenure_months": 24
}
```

### Record a Repayment

```http
POST /api/repayments
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "loan_id": 1,
    "payment_date": "2024-02-20",
    "amount_paid": 2500.00,
    "payment_mode": "BANK",
    "reference_no": "TXN-12345678"
}
```

## Filtering and Pagination

All listing endpoints support filtering and pagination:

### Branch Filtering

```http
GET /api/branches?region=Central&district=Dhaka&per_page=10
```

### Client Filtering

```http
GET /api/clients?branch_id=1&gender=FEMALE&from_date=2024-01-01&to_date=2024-12-31
```

### Loan Filtering

```http
GET /api/loans?status=ACTIVE&branch_id=1&from_date=2024-01-01
```

### Repayment Filtering

```http
GET /api/repayments?loan_id=1&payment_mode=BANK&from_date=2024-01-01
```

## Analytics Endpoints

### Loan Summary

```http
GET /api/analytics/loan-summary
```

Returns total loans, disbursed amounts, status breakdown, and averages.

### Branch Performance

```http
GET /api/analytics/branch-performance
```

Returns performance metrics for each branch including client counts and loan statistics.

### Client Statistics

```http
GET /api/analytics/client-statistics
```

Returns client demographics and distribution statistics.

## Data Validation

The API includes comprehensive validation:

- **Branch names** must be unique
- **Loan amounts** must be between 1,000 and 1,000,000
- **Interest rates** must be between 0% and 50%
- **Payment amounts** cannot exceed reasonable limits
- **Dates** are validated for format and logical constraints

## Business Logic

- **Automatic loan closure** when full repayment is made
- **Repayment validation** against remaining loan balance
- **Cascade restrictions** prevent deletion of records with dependencies
- **Status management** for loans (ACTIVE ‚Üí CLOSED/DEFAULTED)

## Best Practices Implemented

- **RESTful API design** with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- **Eloquent relationships** for efficient database queries
- **Request validation** with Laravel's validation system
- **Database indexing** for optimal query performance
- **Proper error handling** with meaningful error messages
- **Consistent response format** across all endpoints
